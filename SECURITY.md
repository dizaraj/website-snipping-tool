# Privacy Policy for Website Snipping Tool
Effective Date: August 10, 2025

### Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how the Website Snipping Tool Chrome Extension ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information. Your privacy is critically important to us. Our fundamental policy is that we do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data. The extension is designed to work entirely on your local computer.

### Information We Collect
**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.**

The data generated and handled by the extension, such as:
- Screenshots of your current tab
- Annotations you draw (lines, shapes)
- Text you add to the snip

is processed exclusively on your local machine within your browser. This information is never sent to our servers or any third-party service.

### How We Use Your Information
Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use your information in any way. The data generated is used only for the core functionality of the extension, which is to allow you to capture, annotate, and save a selected area of a webpage to your own computer.

### Permissions Explained
The extension requires the following permissions to function correctly, and they are used only for the purposes described below:
- `"activeTab"`: This permission is required to allow the extension to run on the page you are currently viewing. It is used to take a screenshot of the visible area and to overlay the selection and annotation tools.
- `"scripting"`: This permission is necessary to inject the code (`content.js` and `content.css`) that creates the snipping interface (the overlay, selection box, and annotation toolbar) on top of the webpage.

The extension does not read, track, or alter the content of any webpage you visit.

### Data Storage
The Website Snipping Tool does not store any data. There is no history of your snips saved by the extension. The final annotated image is only saved when you explicitly click the "Save" button, which downloads the file directly to your computer's local file system, under your full control.

### Third-Party Services
This extension does not include any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy here and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
